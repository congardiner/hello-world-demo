# Overview

This is a basic demonstration of how to populate a print statement using Python, while showcasing the renowned usage of "Hello World!" and as is common within the programming community, nerdy jokes are paramount to the culture. 

My software design is really about as simple as it can get, I created a simplistic program that automatically initializes itself that is encapsulated into a if-else statement that displays a hello-world message, it runs with a timer delay (1 sec) between a series of short messages that are shown within the terminal. For creative flair, I used the ASCII characters to display the 'Hello World!' message in a red font, and a message shown within the main call that is shown within 'blue' in the terminal. 

The purpose of creating this program was to showcase that my IDE is properly configured, and that I can showcase basic programming concepts within a Python program.

# Development Environment

I used the terminal, pylance, visual code studio, Github and Python to ensure that my code was clean, with no errors in spelling and that my syntax is correct with the logic utilized. This was further verified as I tested my program to ensure that it met the requirements.
